# Work Locks

Prevents two agents/sessions from independently working the same task.

## Rules
- Acquire a lock before substantive implementation.
- One active lock per Task ID. Related subtasks may have separate IDs.
- A lock records holder/session, branch, start/update time and scope.
- A second worker must inspect the existing lock and continue/coordinate rather than restart.
- Locks older than 24h are STALE, not free: reconcile `STARTED_WORK.md`, PRs, commits and receipts before replacing.
- Release only after updating `STARTED_WORK.md` and the execution receipt.
