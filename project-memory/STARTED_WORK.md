# Started Work Register

Canonical register for work that has started but is not yet fully completed.

## Rules
- Add an entry as soon as substantive work begins.
- Every active `IN_PROGRESS`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, or `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED` task must appear here until closed or superseded.
- Never delete history; close with status, date, result, evidence and next step.
- Cross-link Task ID, Change Request, PR/branch, dependencies, work lock and execution receipt.
