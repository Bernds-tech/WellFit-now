# WellFit-now Evidence and Acceptance

Implementation and acceptance are separate states.

Status model: `IMPLEMENTED`, `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `ACCEPTED`, `PRODUCTION_CONFIRMED`. Historical `DONE` remains valid only for v1 records.

Every evidence record should contain a unique evidence ID, related task/change ID, date, target/environment, evidence type, immutable reference where practical, result, limitations and acceptance state. Never store secrets or private user data.
